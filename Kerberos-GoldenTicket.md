## Kerberos Golden Ticket

Golden Tickets are forged TGTs. What this means is we bypass steps (AS REQ) and (AS REP) where we prove to the DC who we are. Having a valid TGT of a privileged account, we can now request a TGS for almost any service we want. In order to forge a golden ticket, we need the KRBTGT account's password hash so that we can sign a TGT for any user account we want. Some interesting notes about Golden Tickets:

- By injecting at this stage of the Kerberos process, we don't need the password hash of the account we want to impersonate since we bypass that step. The TGT is only used to prove that the KDC on a DC signed it. Since it was signed by the KRBTGT hash, this verification passes and the TGT is declared valid no matter its contents.
- Speaking of contents, the KDC will only validate the user account specified in the TGT if it is older than 20 minutes. This means we can put a disabled, deleted, or non-existent account in the TGT, and it will be valid as long as we ensure the timestamp is not older than 20 minutes.
- Since the policies and rules for tickets are set in the TGT itself, we could overwrite the values pushed by the KDC, such as, for example, that tickets should only be valid for 10 hours. We could, for instance, ensure that our TGT is valid for 10 years, granting us persistence.
- By default, the KRBTGT account's password never changes, meaning once we have it, unless it is manually rotated, we have persistent access by generating TGTs forever.
- The blue team would have to rotate the KRBTGT account's password twice, since the current and previous passwords are kept valid for the account. This is to ensure that accidental rotation of the password does not impact services.
- Rotating the KRBTGT account's password is an incredibly painful process for the blue team since it will cause a significant amount of services in the environment to stop working. They think they have a valid TGT, sometimes for the next couple of hours, but that TGT is no longer valid. Not all services are smart enough to release the TGT is no longer valid (since the timestamp is still valid) and thus won't auto-request a new TGT.
- Golden tickets would even allow you to bypass smart card authentication, since the smart card is verified by the DC before it creates the TGT.
- We can generate a golden ticket on any machine, even one that is not domain-joined (such as our own attack machine), making it harder for the blue team to detect.

Apart from the KRBTGT account's password hash, we only need the domain name, domain SID, and user ID for the person we want to impersonate. If we are in a position where we can recover the KRBTGT account's password hash, we would already be in a position where we can recover the other pieces of the required information.
